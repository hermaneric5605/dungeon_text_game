Dungeon Concepts
Before you can develop your classes, you have to figure out what you’re trying to model. Your dungeon isn’t going to be complex at all, but you’ll design it to cope with at least the following
concepts:

Dungeon: You need a general class that encapsulates the entire concept of the dungeon
game.

Player: The player provides the link between the dungeon and you. All experience of
the dungeon comes through the player. The player can move between rooms in the
dungeon.

Rooms: The rooms of the dungeon are the locations that the player can navigate
between. These will be linked together in multiple ways (doors to the north, west, east,
and south, for example) and have descriptions.
